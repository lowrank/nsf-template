% one page limit for **Synergistic Activities**

% List five distinct examples of synergistic activities that demonstrate the broader impact of your 
% professional and scholarly activities that focus on the integration and transfer of knowledge as well as its 
% creation. 

% Each item must be one activity and must not be followed by a listing of additional sub-activities. For 
% example, it is acceptable to summarize that the PI served on ten review panels, however, the PI must not 
% list the specific panels for that distinct example.
