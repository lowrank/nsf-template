% Education Activities â€“ The education component of the proposal may be in a broad range of areas and may be directed to any level: K-12 students,
% undergraduates, graduate students, and/or the general public, but should be related to the proposed research and consistent with the career goals of the PI.
% Some examples are: incorporating research activities into undergraduate courses; teaching a graduate seminar on the topic of the research; designing
% innovative courses or curricula; providing mentored international research experiences for U.S. students; linking education activities to industrial, international, or
% cross-disciplinary work; supporting teacher preparation and enhancement; conducting outreach and mentoring activities to enhance scientific literacy or involve
% students from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in science; researching students' learning and conceptual development in the discipline;
% implementing innovative methods for evaluation and assessment; or creating cyberinfrastructure that facilitates involvement of the broad citizenry in the scientific
% enterprise. Education activities may also include designing new or adapting and implementing effective educational materials and practices. Such activities
% should be consistent with research and best practices in curriculum, pedagogy, and evaluation. Proposers may build on, or otherwise meaningfully participate in,
% existing NSF-supported activities or other educational projects ongoing on campus.

% a description of other broader impacts, besides the education activities, that will accrue from the project. Impacts on other field, interdisciplinary research, International/Global Dimensions 
The overall objective of this proposal aims at developing new directions of scientific computing for applications with RTE models by bringing the advantages of existing numerical methods together. The potential applications are widespread in many fields such as biomedical imaging, biofuel engineering, national security, etc. The resulting numerical algorithms in this proposal will directly impact these applications and provide fast, efficient, and reliable computational tools. Moreover, the new developments will be helpful to applied mathematicians, biomedical engineers, and practitioners from other disciplines who need to study linear and nonlinear transport models and related computational inverse problems. The PI will adjust the results into undergraduate/graduate scientific computation courses for mathematics, engineering, and biology. This proposal also seeks further collaborations from material science and biofuel engineering and more ideas will evolve as the project proceeds. Besides the educational impacts, the other broader impacts envisioned are outlined below.
